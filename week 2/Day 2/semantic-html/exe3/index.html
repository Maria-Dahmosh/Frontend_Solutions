      <summary>What is the best time of year to visit Italy?</summary>
      <p>
        The best time to visit Italy depends on your preferences. Spring (April
        to June) and autumn (September to October) are generally considered the
        best times to visit as the weather is mild and crowds are fewer compared
        to peak summer months. However, summer (June to August) is popular for
        beach vacations and festivals, while winter (December to February) can
        be great for skiing in the Alps or enjoying cultural events in cities.
